Project:	CS2010, Lab #4
		Computer Memory Simulation

Date Issued:	12-Nov-2014
Date Archived:	[REDACTED]

Comments:	This lab consists of just one program: memsim

		- memsim: This program is designed to demonstrate the functionality
			  of the Memory class.  Simply executing the program will
			  demonstrate a block dump and a complete Memory dump;
			  examine the code in the file ./memory_simulator/driver.cpp
			  to see what's actually going on.

MAKE:		./memsim	Creates the memsim program described above.
		./clean		Removes memsim program.
		./archive	Creates a .tar in parent-directory (../).
		
GIT Repository:			https://github.com/kaethis/CS2010_Lab04.git

Notes (Optional):		- Modify the ./memory_simulator/driver.cpp file as
				  you see fit, but hopefully I provided enough code
				  and documentation to sufficiently demonstrate my
				  Memory class.
